# <Home Page for Horiseon Company>

## Description

Refactored code to make the html and CSS files more structured and accessibility compliant. I made the following changes:
1. Added a website title.
2. Gave all images an alt attribute.
3. Replaced all divs in the index.html with main, section, nav, header and footer tags.
4. Consolidated duplicate classes with one class in the content and benefit sections.
